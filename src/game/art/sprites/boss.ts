 * 2D the figure was lying flat in a world seen from above, so it is rebuilt
 * here on the same pipeline as the player and the zombies.
 *
 * One body, tinted per boss rather than authored per boss: `BOSS_DEFS` already
 * carries a single `color` for exactly this reason ("drawBoss() shades this
 * into torso/head/limb tones"), and every boss is the same hulking silhouette.
